### W6100-io Overview

W6100-io is a compact size network module that includes a W6100 (TCP/IP
hardwired chip and PHY embedded).It can be used
as a component and no effort is required to interface W6100.
The W6100-io an ideal option for users who want to
develop their Internet enabling systems rapidly. W6100-io is hardware
compatible with W5100s-io and W5500-io.

For the detailed information on implementation of Hardware TCP/IP, refer
to the [W6100 Datasheet](https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet/W6100/document)
