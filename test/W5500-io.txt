## W5500-io Overview

W5500-io is a compact size network module that includes a W5500 (TCP/IP
hardwired chip and PHY embedded).It can be used
as a component and no effort is required to interface W5500.
The W5500-io an ideal option for users who want to
develop their Internet enabling systems rapidly. W5500-io is hardware
compatible with W5100s-io and W6100-io.

For the detailed information on implementation of Hardware TCP/IP, refer
to the [W5500 Datasheet](https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet/W5500/datasheet)
