# S2E Module

The 'Serial to Ethernet' (S2E) Products from WIZnet are a line of modules designed to convert various UART protocols (TTL, RS-232, or RS-422/485) into TCP/IP. These modules facilitate remote monitoring, management, and control of TCP/IP devices via a UART serial interface. The WIZnet S2E product family supports a diverse range of pin header types and hardware interfaces.

Here's an overview of the product family with relevant details:

1. **WIZ500SR-RP**: Offers 1x TTL (3.3V) UART, transformer-based LAN interface, 1x12 pin header (2.0mm pitch), operating temperatures from -20 to 85℃, and dimensions of 50mm x 30mm x 5.7mm. It comes with the WIZ500SR-RP-EVB evaluation board. Product details: https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/S2E-Module/WIZ5xxSR-RP-Series/WIZ500SR-RP/overview.
2. **WIZ505SR-RP**: Features 1x TTL (3.3V) UART, RJ-45 LAN interface, 2x7 pin header (2.54mm pitch), operates from -20 to 85℃, with dimensions of 40mm x 66.5mm x 15mm. The associated evaluation board is WIZ505SR-RP-EVB. More information: https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/S2E-Module/WIZ5xxSR-RP-Series/WIZ505SR-RP/overview.
3. **WIZ510SR-RP**: This module has 1x TTL (3.3V) UART, RJ-45 LAN interface, 1x4 pin header (2.54mm pitch), an operating temperature range of -20 to 85℃, and measures 76mm x 45mm x 15mm. It does not have an associated evaluation board. Details at: https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/S2E-Module/WIZ5xxSR-RP-Series/WIZ510SR-RP/overview.
4. **W7500S2E-R1**: Offers 1x TTL (3.3V) UART, transformer LAN interface, 1x11 and 1x12 pin headers (2.54mm), operates from -40 to 85℃, with dimensions of 44.45×31.75×23.00mm. It comes with a breakout board. Product page: http://wiznetshop.co.kr/product/detail.html?product_no=814&cate_no=56&display_group=1.
5. **W5500S2E Series**: Includes models like W5500S2E-Z1, W5500S2E-S1, each with unique characteristics such as different LAN interfaces, pin headers, and dimensions. They all operate within the -40 to 85℃ temperature range and have associated breakout boards.
6. **WIZ100SR, WIZ105SR, WIZ110SR, WIZ107SR, WIZ108SR, WIZ120SR, WIZ125SR**: These models are not recommended for new designs but come with various features including different UART and LAN interfaces, pin headers, and temperature ranges. They also have associated evaluation boards.
7. **WIZ140SR, WIZ145SR**: Also not recommended for new designs, these models offer multiple TTL (3.3V) UART interfaces, various LAN interfaces, pin headers, and operating temperature ranges. Each comes with its own evaluation board.
8. **W7100A-S2E**: This is a pre-programmed MCU with Serial to Ethernet chip, not recommended for new designs.
