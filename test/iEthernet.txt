# iEthernet

1. **iEthernet Overview**: iEthernet is an Ethernet controller chip from WIZnet that integrates a hardwired TCP/IP core and MAC (and PHY). It serves as a robust solution for Ethernet connectivity. More information on iEthernet can be found in the overview section at https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet#overview.
2. **WIZnet W6100**: The W6100 chip is designed to support TCP/IPv4/IPv6, MAC, and PHY. It offers a host interface of 8bit BUS and Fast SPI, and a buffer size of 32KB. The chip can handle up to 8 hardware sockets and delivers a network performance of maximum 25Mbps. Its operational temperature ranges from -40 to +85째C. The W6100 comes in a 48LQFP/QFN package and measures 7x7. For more details on the W6100, including its evaluation board, visit https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet/W6100.
3. **WIZnet W5100S**: This model features a TCP/IP, MAC, and PHY core, with a 16KB TX/RX buffer and support for 4 hardware sockets. The W5100S operates at a maximum network speed of 25Mbps and supports an 8bit BUS and SPI host interface. It's available in a 48LQFP/QFN package, measuring 7x7, and functions in a temperature range of -40 to +85째C. Detailed information on the W5100S can be found at https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet/W5100S/overview.
4. **WIZnet W5500**: The W5500 chip is equipped with a TCP/IP, MAC, and PHY embedded core, a 32KB buffer, and supports 8 hardware sockets. It offers a Fast SPI host interface and delivers a network performance of up to 15Mbps. The chip operates in the temperature range of -40 to +85째C and is available in a 48LQFP package with dimensions of 7x7. For more details on the W5500, visit https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet/W5500/overview.
5. **WIZnet W5300**: This model includes a TCP/IP, MAC, and PHY core, with a large 128KB TX/RX buffer and 8 hardware sockets. The W5300 supports an 8/16bit BUS host interface and boasts a high network performance of maximum 80Mbps. It functions in a temperature range of -40 to +85째C and comes in a 100LQFP package measuring 14x14. Learn more about the W5300 at https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet/W5300.
6. **Caution Notice for W5200**: It's important to note that the W5200 chip is not recommended for new designs and is not supported by ioLibrary. If you have any questions, please refer to the WIZnet forum at [https://forum.wiznet.io](https://forum.wiznet.io/) or contact WIZnet directly at [https://www.wiznet.io/inqueries/](https://www.wiznet.io/inqueries/).
7. **Product Application Projects**: WIZnet has compiled a variety of projects for W5x00, W6100, and W7500, focusing on integration version projects called W5x00. The projects for W5100, W5200, and W5300 implemented as AVRs are not specified here.
